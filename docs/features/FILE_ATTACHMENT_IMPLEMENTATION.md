# File Attachment Feature with Stored Content Approach

**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Related Feature:** File attachments in model comparisons with conversation history persistence

---

## 🎯 Overview

Implemented a file attachment system that allows users to attach text, code, and document files (PDF, DOCX, DOC, ODT) to their model comparison queries. The system uses a **"Stored Content Approach"** where file contents are extracted and stored separately from placeholders, enabling file content to persist across conversation sessions and be available for follow-up questions.

---

## 🎨 User Experience

### Initial File Attachment

- Users can attach files via:
  - **File input button**: Click to browse and select files
  - **Drag and drop**: Drag files onto the textarea or action section
- When a file is attached, a placeholder appears in the textarea: `[file: filename.txt]`
- Users can add their own text before or after one or more file placeholders
- Multiple files can be attached in any order

### Display in History

- Conversation history shows **placeholders only** (e.g., `[file: filename.txt]`)
- File contents are **not displayed** in history to keep it clean and readable
- File contents are stored separately and available for follow-ups

### Follow-Up Conversations

- When loading a conversation from history, stored file contents are restored
- Follow-up questions can reference attached files (e.g., "What are the first 5 words of this file?")
- Models receive the **expanded file content** in conversation history, not placeholders
- Models can answer questions about file contents even in follow-ups

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Stored Content Approach

The implementation uses a "Stored Content Approach" to solve the file persistence problem:

**Problem:** Browser `File` objects cannot be persisted across sessions. When a user exits and returns, the `File` objects are lost, making placeholders unusable.

**Solution:** Extract and store file contents separately:

- **Placeholders** are shown in history (clean, readable)
- **File contents** are stored separately (persistent, available for follow-ups)
- On follow-up, stored contents are used instead of placeholders

### Data Flow

#### 1. File Upload (New Conversation)

```
User attaches file → File object created → Content extracted →
Placeholder inserted in textarea → On submit: Content expanded →
Sent to models with explicit formatting
```

#### 2. Saving Conversation

```
Conversation saved → Extract file content from File objects →
Store content separately in file_contents array →
Save input_data with placeholders → Store file_contents alongside
```

#### 3. Loading Conversation

```
Load from history → Retrieve file_contents →
Create StoredAttachedFile objects → Restore attachedFiles state →
Placeholders visible in textarea, content available for expansion
```

#### 4. Follow-Up Submission

```
User asks follow-up → Expand placeholders in conversation history →
Expand placeholders in new input → Send expanded content to models →
Models see file content in history and can answer questions
```

## 📋 Implementation Details

### Frontend Components

#### 1. File Attachment Interfaces

**Location:** `frontend/src/components/comparison/ComparisonForm.tsx`

```typescript
// For newly attached files (with File objects)
export interface AttachedFile {
  id: string; // Unique identifier
  file: File; // Browser File object
  name: string; // File name
  placeholder: string; // Placeholder text: "[file: filename.txt]"
}

// For files loaded from history (with stored content)
export interface StoredAttachedFile {
  id: string; // Unique identifier
  name: string; // File name
  placeholder: string; // Placeholder text: "[file: filename.txt]"
  content: string; // Extracted file content (stored for persistence)
}
```

#### 2. File Content Expansion

**Location:** `frontend/src/App.tsx`

The `expandFiles` function handles both `AttachedFile[]` and `StoredAttachedFile[]`:

```typescript
const expandFiles = async (
  files: (AttachedFile | StoredAttachedFile)[],
  userInput: string
): Promise<string> => {
  // Extract content from File objects (AttachedFile) or use stored content (StoredAttachedFile)
  // Replace placeholders with explicit file markers:
  // [FILE: filename]
  // <file content>
  // [/FILE: filename]
  // Preserves order of user input and files
};
```

**Explicit Formatting for Models:**

- File content is wrapped in clear markers: `[FILE: filename]...[/FILE: filename]`
- Makes it very clear to models what is file content vs user input
- Handles any combination: files before text, text before files, mixed order

#### 3. File Content Extraction Helper

**Location:** `frontend/src/App.tsx`

```typescript
const extractFileContentForStorage = async (
  files: AttachedFile[]
): Promise<Array<{ name: string; content: string; placeholder: string }>> => {
  // Extracts content from File objects for storage
  // Handles PDF, DOCX, DOC, ODT, and text files
  // Returns array ready for storage
};
```

#### 4. Conversation History Storage

**Location:** `frontend/src/hooks/useConversationHistory.ts`

```typescript
const saveConversationToLocalStorage = (
  inputData: string, // Contains placeholders
  modelsUsed: string[],
  conversationsToSave: ModelConversation[],
  isUpdate: boolean = false,
  fileContents?: Array<{
    // Extracted file contents
    name: string;
    content: string;
    placeholder: string;
  }>
): string => {
  // Stores conversation with:
  // - input_data: Contains placeholders (shown in history)
  // - file_contents: Extracted file content (used for follow-ups)
  // - messages: Conversation messages
};
```

#### 5. Conversation Loading

**Location:** `frontend/src/App.tsx`

```typescript
const loadConversation = async (summary: ConversationSummary) => {
  // Loads conversation data
  // Retrieves file_contents from storage
  // Creates StoredAttachedFile objects
  // Restores attachedFiles state
  // Sets input with placeholders
};
```

#### 6. Follow-Up History Expansion

**Location:** `frontend/src/App.tsx` (in `handleSubmit`)

```typescript
// Expand file placeholders in conversation history for follow-ups
if (isFollowUpMode && conversations.length > 0) {
  const expandedMessages = await Promise.all(
    deduplicatedMessages.map(async (msg) => {
      if (msg.role === "user" && attachedFiles.length > 0) {
        // Check if message contains file placeholders
        if (hasPlaceholder) {
          // Expand placeholders using stored file contents
          const expandedContent = await expandFiles(attachedFiles, msg.content);
          return { ...msg, content: expandedContent };
        }
      }
      return msg;
    })
  );
  apiConversationHistory = expandedMessages;
}
```

### Supported File Types

- **Text files**: `.txt`, `.md`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.csv`, etc.
- **Code files**: `.js`, `.ts`, `.py`, `.java`, `.cpp`, `.html`, `.css`, etc.
- **Documents**: `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.doc`, `.odt`

### File Processing

- **PDF files**: Extracted using `pdfjsLib` (PDF.js)
- **DOCX files**: Extracted using `mammoth` library
- **DOC/ODT files**: Attempted as text first, fallback to error handling
- **Text/Code files**: Read directly using `FileReader`

## 🔄 Data Storage

### Anonymous Users (localStorage)

**Storage Structure:**

```json
{
  "input_data": "[file: test.txt] Please review this",
  "models_used": ["model1", "model2"],
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "messages": [...],
  "file_contents": [
    {
      "name": "test.txt",
      "content": "File content here...",
      "placeholder": "[file: test.txt]"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Limitations:**

- localStorage typically limited to 5-10MB per domain
- Very large files may hit storage limits
- Not a tier restriction - applies to all anonymous users

### Authenticated Users (Database)

**Storage Structure:**

- `input_data`: Contains placeholders (shown in history)
- `file_contents`: Stored as JSON array in database
- `messages`: Conversation messages with placeholders

**Benefits:**

- No size limitations (within database constraints)
- Persistent across devices
- Backed up with database

---

- Available for follow-up questions
- Works across sessions (close browser, return later)

### 3. Explicit Formatting

- Models receive clear file markers: `[FILE: filename]...[/FILE: filename]`
- Distinguishes file content from user input
- Handles any combination of files and text

### 4. Order Preservation

- Maintains original order of files and user input
- Files can appear before, after, or between text
- Multiple files supported in any order

### 5. Follow-Up Support

- Conversation history expanded with file content
- Models can reference files in follow-ups
- "What are the first 5 words of this file?" works correctly

### 6. Token Counting

- Accurate token counting includes expanded file contents
- Token estimation API receives expanded input
- Client-side fallback accounts for file sizes

## 🔧 Technical Details

### State Management

**Attached Files State:**

```typescript
const [attachedFiles, setAttachedFiles] = useState<
  (AttachedFile | StoredAttachedFile)[]
>([]);
```

- Can contain both `AttachedFile` (new uploads) and `StoredAttachedFile` (from history)
- Type-safe handling of both types
- Seamless transition between types

### File Expansion Logic

**Order Preservation Algorithm:**

1. Extract content from all files (File objects or stored content)
2. Create map of placeholder → content
3. Iterate through user input
4. Replace each placeholder with `[FILE: name]\ncontent\n[/FILE: name]`
5. Preserve all user text and file order

**Error Handling:**

- Failed file extraction: Placeholder replaced with error note
- Missing stored content: Placeholder removed with error note
- Continues processing other files even if one fails

### Conversation History Expansion

**For Follow-Ups:**

- User messages in history checked for file placeholders
- If placeholders found, expand using stored file contents
- Assistant messages unchanged (already contain responses)
- Expanded history sent to models

**Benefits:**

- Models see file content in conversation history
- Can answer questions about files in follow-ups
- Maintains context across conversation turns

## 🧪 Testing Considerations

### Test Scenarios

1. **New File Upload**

   - Attach file → Placeholder appears → Submit → Content expanded → Model receives content

2. **Multiple Files**

   - Attach multiple files → Placeholders appear → Submit → All expanded → Order preserved

3. **Mixed Input**

   - Add text → Attach file → Add more text → Submit → Order preserved

4. **History Loading**

   - Save conversation → Close browser → Reopen → Load history → Files restored → Placeholders visible

5. **Follow-Up Questions**

   - Load conversation with files → Ask follow-up → History expanded → Model sees file content → Answers correctly

6. **File Types**

   - Test PDF, DOCX, DOC, ODT, text, code files
   - Verify extraction works for all types

7. **Error Cases**
   - Corrupted files → Error handling → Other files still work
   - Missing stored content → Error note → Conversation continues

---

## 📊 Token Counting

### Accurate Token Estimation

**Process:**

1. User types input with file placeholders
2. Files attached (or loaded from history)
3. `onExpandFiles` callback expands files
4. Expanded input sent to `/estimate-tokens` API
5. Accurate token count returned
6. Displayed in UI

**Client-Side Fallback:**

- If backend token count not available, estimate using:
  - User input length
  - Attached file sizes (rough character count)
  - Formula: `(inputLength + fileSizes) / 4` (rough tokens)

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### File Attachment UI

- **File input button**: Standard file picker
- **Drag and drop**: Visual feedback when dragging over textarea
- **Placeholder display**: Shows `[file: filename.txt]` in textarea
- **Multiple files**: All placeholders visible
- **File removal**: Can remove files before submission

### History Display

- **Clean placeholders**: History shows `[file: filename.txt]`
- **No content clutter**: File contents not shown
- **Visual indication**: Users know files were attached

### Follow-Up Experience

- **Seamless restoration**: Files restored automatically
- **Placeholders visible**: Users see what files were attached
- **Context preserved**: Models can reference files

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### File Type Validation

- Only text, code, and document files allowed
- Binary files rejected
- File type checked before processing

### Content Extraction

- Files processed client-side (browser)
- No file upload to server (content extracted locally)
- Only extracted text content sent to API
- Original files never leave user's browser

### Storage Security

- **Anonymous users**: localStorage (browser storage)
- **Authenticated users**: Database (server storage)
- File contents stored as plain text (same as user input)

---

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### File Processing

- **Async processing**: File extraction is async (non-blocking)
- **Parallel extraction**: Multiple files processed in parallel
- **Error handling**: Failed files don't block others

### Storage Size

- **localStorage limits**: 5-10MB per domain (anonymous users)
- **Database storage**: No practical limits (authenticated users)
- **Large files**: May hit localStorage limits for anonymous users

### Token Counting

- **Debounced API calls**: Token estimation debounced (600ms)
- **Cached results**: Results cached until input changes
- **Fallback estimation**: Client-side fallback if API unavailable

---
