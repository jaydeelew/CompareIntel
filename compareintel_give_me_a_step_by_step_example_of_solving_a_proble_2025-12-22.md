Let's solve a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula.

**Problem:** Solve the equation $x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$ for $x$.

**Step 1: Identify the coefficients a, b, and c.**

A standard quadratic equation is of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.
By comparing our equation $x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$ to the standard form:
* $a = 1$ (the coefficient of $x^2$)
* $b = -5$ (the coefficient of $x$)
* $c = 6$ (the constant term)

**Step 2: Write down the quadratic formula.**

The quadratic formula is:
$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

**Step 3: Substitute the values of a, b, and c into the formula.**

Substitute $a=1$, $b=-5$, and $c=6$ into the formula:
$x = \frac{-(-5) \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4(1)(6)}}{2(1)}$

**Step 4: Simplify the expression.**

*   **Simplify the term $-(-5)$:**
    $-(-5) = 5$

*   **Simplify $b^2$ ($(-5)^2$):**
    $(-5)^2 = 25$

*   **Simplify $4ac$ ($4(1)(6)$):**
    $4(1)(6) = 24$

*   **Simplify $2a$ ($2(1)$):**
    $2(1) = 2$

Now substitute these back into the formula:
$x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 - 24}}{2}$

**Step 5: Calculate the value inside the square root (the discriminant).**

The expression inside the square root is $b^2 - 4ac$, which is called the discriminant.
$25 - 24 = 1$

So the formula becomes:
$x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{1}}{2}$

**Step 6: Evaluate the square root.**

$\sqrt{1} = 1$

Now the formula is:
$x = \frac{5 \pm 1}{2}$

**Step 7: Calculate the two possible solutions for x.**

The $\pm$ sign means we have two possible solutions: one where we add 1 and one where we subtract 1.

*   **Solution 1 (using the + sign):**
    $x_1 = \frac{5 + 1}{2}$
    $x_1 = \frac{6}{2}$
    $x_1 = 3$

*   **Solution 2 (using the - sign):**
    $x_2 = \frac{5 - 1}{2}$
    $x_2 = \frac{4}{2}$
    $x_2 = 2$

**Step 8: State the solutions.**

The solutions to the equation $x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$ are $x = 3$ and $x = 2$.

**Step 9: (Optional) Verify the solutions.**

You can always check your answers by plugging them back into the original equation.

*   **Check $x=3$:**
    $(3)^2 - 5(3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = -6 + 6 = 0$
    This is correct.

*   **Check $x=2$:**
    $(2)^2 - 5(2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = -6 + 6 = 0$
    This is also correct.

Okay, let's walk through solving a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, step-by-step.

**1. Understand the Quadratic Formula and Standard Form**

*   **The Quadratic Formula:**  The quadratic formula is used to find the solutions (also called roots or x-intercepts) of any quadratic equation. It is:

    x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a)

*   **Standard Form of a Quadratic Equation:**  The quadratic formula works when the quadratic equation is in standard form:

    ax² + bx + c = 0

    Where:
    *   'a', 'b', and 'c' are coefficients (numbers).
    *   'x' is the variable.

**2. Identify a Quadratic Equation to Solve**

Let's use the following example:

2x² + 5x - 3 = 0

**3. Identify 'a', 'b', and 'c'**

Compare our example equation to the standard form (ax² + bx + c = 0) and identify the values of 'a', 'b', and 'c':

*   a = 2
*   b = 5
*   c = -3

**4. Substitute the Values into the Quadratic Formula**

Now, carefully substitute the values of 'a', 'b', and 'c' into the quadratic formula:

x = (-5 ± √(5² - 4 * 2 * -3)) / (2 * 2)

**5. Simplify the Expression**

Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) to simplify the equation:

*   **Simplify inside the square root:**

    *   5² = 25
    *   4 * 2 * -3 = -24
    *   25 - (-24) = 25 + 24 = 49

*   **Substitute the simplified square root value:**

     x = (-5 ± √49) / (2 * 2)

*   **Calculate the square root:**

      x = (-5 ± 7) / (2 * 2)

*   **Simplify the denominator:**

       x = (-5 ± 7) / 4

**6. Solve for the Two Possible Values of 'x'**

The "±" (plus or minus) sign indicates that there are two possible solutions for 'x'. Solve for each one:

*   **Solution 1 (using the + sign):**

    x = (-5 + 7) / 4
    x = 2 / 4
    x = 1/2  or x = 0.5

*   **Solution 2 (using the - sign):**

    x = (-5 - 7) / 4
    x = -12 / 4
    x = -3

**7. State Your Solutions**

The solutions to the quadratic equation 2x² + 5x - 3 = 0 are:

x = 1/2  and x = -3

**Summary of Steps**

1.  **Identify the quadratic equation** in standard form: ax² + bx + c = 0
2.  **Determine the values of 'a', 'b', and 'c'.**
3.  **Substitute** the values into the quadratic formula.
4.  **Simplify** the expression, paying close attention to the order of operations.
5.  **Solve for the two possible values of 'x'**, one using the plus sign and one using the minus sign from the "±".
6.  **State your solutions** for 'x'.
**Important Tips:**

*   **Double-Check Your Work:**  Carefully check your calculations at each step to avoid errors. Especially watch your signs!
*   **Dealing with Negative Numbers:**  Be very careful when dealing with negative numbers within the quadratic formula, especially during the simplification step.
*   **Imaginary Solutions:** Sometimes, the value inside the square root (b² - 4ac), called the discriminant, is negative. If this occurs, the solutions will be imaginary numbers (involving 'i', where i = √-1).  If you are not working with complex numbers, you would state that there are no real solutions. For example, the discriminant is -1, the solution would include √-1, written as "i".

Let me know if you'd like to work through another example, or want to explore more complex scenarios (like those with imaginary solutions)!
